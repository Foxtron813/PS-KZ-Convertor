I , the author, have no problem with sharing this code, note:
--it would be very much appreciated if when used, said individual would note where the code was taken from (from here)--
Said files/code was made for a university course work project so it is intended for learning purposes and testing.
The code itself is very simple and can probably be recreated without too much effort or time.
